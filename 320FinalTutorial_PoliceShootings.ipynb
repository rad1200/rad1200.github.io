We create this metric by dividing the number of people killed for each race per state by the number of people of that race (state population multiplied by percent of Race in that state). This proportion will put the number of people killed per race for each state in context with the population size and percentage of race for the state, giving us a more accurate representation of the distribution of fatal shootings."

    "This map shows the state name, proportion of Black Americans killed relative to the states' Black population, and number of protests when hovering over a given state. If you compare this map to the map that precedes it, you can see that the states that were previously leading in proportion of Black Americans are not actually the states with the highest proportion of their state's Black Americans killed. However, we see that the top 4 states (Utah, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Alaska) have very low numbers of BLM protests (20, 30, 26, and 25). It might be intuitive to say that there would be a greater presence of BLM protests in states where there is a higher rate of Black Americans being killed in police shootings, but we see that this is not the case here. In fact, some of the states with the lowest rates, such as New York, New Jersey, and Massachussetts have a much higher number of BLM protests (248, 158, and 144)."

The RMSE values were 1.87 for the training dataset and 2.47 for the testing dataset. One reason why the RMSE values are likely so low is that the range of the number of Black Americans killed post June 2020 is not nearly as large as say, the number of protests in the states. This means that the predictions likely won't deviate as much. However, we do see that the model, while not perfect, is doing pretty well at predicting the training dataset and is doing a decent job at predicting the testing dataset as we see based on the R^2."

    "To summarize this tutorial, we began by looking at datasets with police shooting data from 2015-2021, state total populations and the percent each race makes up of the population, and BLM protest data from June 2020 to November 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first looked at all the races and the proportion of them being killed in police shootings per state based on their makeup of each state. We found that Black Americans across states were being killed in police shootings at significantly higher proportions than Asian and White Americans (and similar or higher proportions than Native Americans).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then narrowed our focus on Black Americans being killed in police shootings per state as well as the population of Black Americans per state and seeing how it relates to the number of BLM protests that went on in the state. We found that just because a state had a high proportion of Black Americans killed in Police shootings or high proportion of Black Americans making up the state, doesn't mean the number of protests would be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "We next wanted to see if there was any way we could have predicted the number of protests that would occur in a state and if there was any way we could predicted the number of Black Americans that were killed by police shootings per state in the time following the protests. We wanted to look into these questions to get an idea if the number of BLM protests per state was a direct response to the number of Black Americans killed in the state and more importantly, to get an idea of whether the number of BLM protests in a state has resulted in lower numbers of police shootings of Black Americans in that state compared to other states.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we found while working through these two prediction questions was that there were certain features that correlated well with our values to be predicted. For predicting the number of protests, we found that the number of Black killed in the state before the 2020 protests and the state population were correlated well, and thus we used them as predictors for our model. For predicting the number of Black killed following the start of the protests in 2020, we found that the total number of people killed and the number of protests correlated well, so we used these as our predictors for this model. In both cases, we create decision tree models and random forest models and saw that they had diminished performance on test data compared to training data. However, it is a good start for models that could be improved upon in the future."
